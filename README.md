## Quote of the Dday
### Inspiration
I just wanted to do this challenge on the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine)

### A few words on the workflow

Simple design with Twitter Bootstrap and Google fonts. For CSS I used PostCSS with Gulp.
The quotes are retrieved via a simple Ajax request to the free API of [Quotes on Design](http://quotesondesign.com)

Made this to get a true mobile first design up and running here. The only update I still want to make is when I know how to hide the browser statusbar :-P
